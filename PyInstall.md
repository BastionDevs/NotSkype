# Python Installation
NotSkype relies on the wonderful Python library [SkPy](https://github.com/Terrance/SkPy) to send/receive messages.  
On older systems, up-to-date Python installers are hard to come by. As NotSkype officially supports Windows XP and above, we've located installers for the latest version on each currently unsupported platform:  
* Python 3.4.10 for _Windows XP_  
* <sup>1</sup>Python 3.8.19 for *Windows Vista*/*7*  
 * <sup>1</sup> _Python 3.8 is still being updated for **Security Patches**, and we will package a newer version if/when it comes out._  

## Install Types
* Self-Install  
 * The NotSkype Installer will download a suitable distribution of Python for you to your Desktop. Do follow **all** instructions if a README file is given.  
  
* Install for me  
 * The NotSkype Installer will automatically install Python for you with the recommended options and Packages.  
 * Python will be installed _quietly_ for all users (if applicable) and added to _%PATH%_ (_.py_ to _%PATHEXT%_).  
  
* Skip Python installation  
 * **NOTE: ** NotSkype requires Python to run. Please ensure that a Python runtime is installed and added to _%PATH%_ (either User or System).  
  
The NotSkype Client will install the necessary libraries and packages for you on first run.
